# Ascl1_hiNs

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have revolutionized the study of human development, physiology, and pathology. In the neuroscience field, hiPSC-derived neurons (hiNs) have been used to model complex neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. To date, most of the studies in the literature have employed hiNs generated i) indirectly through the induction of hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hiNPCs), or ii) directly by forced expression of the proneural transcription factor (TF) Neurogenin 2 (Neurog2). We have developed an alternative method to generate hiNs through forced expression of the TF Achaete-Scute Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1 (Ascl1) in hiNPCs, hereafter named Ascl1-hiNs. Using real-time calcium imaging and multi-electrode array electrophysiology, we show that Ascl1-hiNs can establish complex functional and oscillatory neural networks as early as after 2-3 weeks of differentiation. In comparison, spontaneously differentiated hiNs only show some degree of functional network organization after 5 weeks, whereas Neurog2-hiNs show a regular pattern of spiking activity but are unable to establish oscillatory neural networks even after 6 weeks of differentiation.  Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and machine learning based cell classification, we show that both Ascl1-hiNs and Neurog2-hiNs adopt mainly a glutamatergic fate, with a small fraction of cells becoming GABAergic, whereas spontaneously differentiated hiNs generate similar proportions of glutamatergic and GABAergic hiNs. Direct comparison of glutamatergic hiNs generated in the three different protocols reveals a complex set of genes, including ion channels and synaptic proteins, upregulated in Ascl1-hiNs and associated with functional organization of hiNs neural networks. Together, our work describes a new efficient method for the generation of hiNs networks and provides interesting new data about the neuronal molecular setting necessary for the functionality of neural circuits.
